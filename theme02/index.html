              to more than 100 diverse shops and culinary experiences; offices
              for leaders in industry; significant public art such as Vessel;
              dynamic cultural institutions including The Shed; Edge, the
              tallest observation deck in the Western hemisphere; modern
              residences; 14 acres of public plazas, gardens and groves; and the
              world’s first Equinox Hotel.

              Celebrated in song, glamorized on celluloid and immortalized in
              poetry, the postcard-perfect Brooklyn Bridge stands as one of New
              York City’s most recognizable symbols—not to mention a magnificent
              feat of engineering. Upon its completion in 1883 it became the
              first roadway to connect Manhattan and Brooklyn, which were then
              separate cities (Brooklyn became part of New York City in 1898).
              Back then, with a central span of 1,595 feet, the Brooklyn Bridge
              was also the world’s longest suspension bridge.

              The winds have shifted in the dining world, with focused, personal
              restaurants grabbing diners’ attention away from international
              celebrity chefs. These days, bragging rights belong to those who
              have had Missy Robbins’ spaghetti with lemon and pine nuts at
              Lilia, in Williamsburg, and Dan Kluger’s crunchy zucchini fries
              with lemon-Parmesan dressing at Loring Place, in Greenwich
              Village. King, in Soho, is another fantastic bistro; its
              European-inspired menu changes daily.
